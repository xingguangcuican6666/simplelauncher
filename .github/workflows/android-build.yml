      # NOTE: The runner typically provides Android SDK tools on ubuntu-latest.
      # The previous action used here (reactivecircus/android-sdk-action) is
      # not available on the runner (repository not found), which caused the
      # job to fail. If you prefer a managed SDK install, replace this block
      # with a maintained action or add an explicit installation step that
      # downloads the Android command-line tools and runs sdkmanager.
